# LAM-Research-Challenge-Round2
LAM Research Challenge was a 3 part challenge held in association with T-Works and IISc,Bengaluru. We as a 4 member team qualified among the top 100 teams from the country for round-2 Problem statement on Peltier module based Thermoelectric Temperature calibration. 

Problem Statement was to develop an innovative method to achieve temperature calibration between 10 to 25° C with an error of 1° C using a Peltier module and PID Control. Total Cost of the Project - Rs 4867 .
